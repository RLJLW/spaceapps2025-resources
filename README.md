## Notes about Challenges and Importance of Challenges

### BloomWatch Challenge

#### Motivation and Importance
Food production is incredibly important for the world, and for that so are pollinators such as bees which also depend on plant blooming.
Pests can also cause damages to crops and if there's a scientific way to compare blooms and bloom extent or even determine the prevalence of species
over a landscape that is really useful. Quantitative decision making is really important, and being able to numerically quantify blooms, and the kinds of vegetation
in a specific area, at a specific time is useful. This is possible with NASA data.
The same tools and data that could be used for analyze plant blooms, vegetation and lanscape analysis could be used in various other useful and important applications.

#### Challenge Description:
"Your challenge is to harness the power of NASA Earth observation data to develop a tool that monitors and visualizes plant blooming events across the globe or within a specific local region, and directly addresses a specific vegetation monitoring, prediction, or management need at your chosen scale."

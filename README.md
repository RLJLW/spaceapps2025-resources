Below are the top projects I'm considering with my notes, and notes from the challenges as to why I think these challenges are interesting and important.

## BloomWatch: An Earth Observation Application for Global Flowering Phenology

#### Motivation and Importance

Food production is incredibly important, and for that so are pollinators such as bees which also depend on plant blooming.

Pests can also cause significant damages to crops and if there's a scientific way to compare blooms and bloom extent or even determine the prevalence of species
over a landscape that is useful. Quantitative decision making is really important, and being able to numerically quantify blooms, and the kinds of vegetation
in a specific area, at a specific time is useful. This is possible with NASA data.
The same tools and data that could be used for analyze plant blooms, vegetation and lanscape analysis could be used in various other useful and important applications.

#### Challenge Description:

"Your challenge is to harness the power of NASA Earth observation data to develop a tool that monitors and visualizes plant blooming events across the globe or within a specific local region, and directly addresses a specific vegetation monitoring, prediction, or management need at your chosen scale."

Things that your project could do (much of this is directly out of the challenge description):
 - Monitoring plant blooming
 - Detect invasive species
 - Monitor the coverage of a landscape by different kinds of vegetation
 - Detect agricultural pests - This could have applications in food production to as pests could change the kind of bloom or vegetation that is present
 - Be useful in agricultural crop monitoring - Also useful for farming / food production 
 - Know when, where, and how extensively plants bloom
 - Make data available to better understand the relationship between pollinators, and the environment
 - Use the following tools: EMIT, PACE, Landsat, MODIS, VIIRS
 - In my view, the same technology or data could be adapted to many other applications
  
## Meteor Madness

#### Motivation and Importance

Asteroids pose a significant risk, such as devestation of population centers, tsunamis, earthquakes, and potential serious atmospheric changes, such as dust blocking out sunlight and affecting food production.

Currently there is no developed technology that is reliable for redirecting an incoming asteroid. Detection of harmful asteroids could be better developed as to take appropriate mitigation strategies and plan ahead there needs to be a significant time between detection and for example bringing deflector into a position where it could attempt to deflect an asteroid.

##### Dectection and Deflection Time Importance:
The earlier a deflector hits an asteroid the more substantial the deflection, so deflection an asteroid months before impact is better than weeks or days before impact.
This means its important to detect the asteroid as early as possible and then move a deflector into position where it can have the most effect.

#### Challenge Description:

"Your challenge is to develop an interactive visualization and simulation tool that enables users to explore asteroid impact scenarios, predict consequences, and evaluate mitigation strategies using real NASA and USGS datasets. Can you create a web-based platform that integrates asteroid parameter data (e.g., size, velocity, trajectory) from NASA’s NEO API with USGS datasets pertaining to environmental and geological impacts (e.g., tsunami zones, seismic activity, topography), and transforms that raw data into a powerful educational and decision-support tool for global asteroid risk management?"

Things that your project could do (much of this is directly out of the challenge description):
 - Model asteroid impact scenarios and predict consequences
 - Evaluate potential mitigation strategies
 - Model an asteroids trajectory
 - Calculate impact energy - Estimate impact kinetic energy with standard methods, E = 1/2 m v^2 for example.
 - Estimate crater size
 - Estimate Environmental effects - You can leverage NASA data (like USGS) to model secondary effects like Tsunamis, seizmic waves.
 - Develop interactive visualization and simulation tools
 - Transform raw data into powerful educational and decision making tools
 - Display impact zone maps
 - Animate Orbital paths, or trajectories
 - Demystify / explain complex concepts
 - Use input parameters such as asteroid, size and velocity
 - Explore what-if scenarios, e.g. how a small change in velocity alters the point of impact or large changes might mitigate the impact.
 - Map tsunami risks using USGS elevation data
 - Use real-time data such as from the NEO database from NASA's API
 - Possibly build a tool that is mobile compatible, or use augmented reality
 - Possibly allow users to share similution results (for example impact maps) on social media
 - Could create a "Defend Earth" mode where users test deflection strategies under time pressure

## Through the Radar Looking Glass: Revealing Earth Processes with SAR

#### Motivation and Importance

SAR (Synthetic Apperture Radar) has numerous applications, landscape coverage, soil moisture in agricultural fields, flooding, especially during disasters, wildfire damage, types and thickness of vegetation, pollution (oil for example), water coverage, ice sheet dynamics, volcanic erruptions, land motion, above ground biomass is forests, land subsidence from ground water pumping, landslides and others.

Because SAR data uses active remote sensing and the wavelengths it uses it can acquire data day or night and even through cloud cover, making it especially valuabe during disasters.
 
#### Challenge Description:

"Your challenge is to peer through the looking glass… by analyzing radar remote sensing data from SAR instruments that employ different polarizations and frequencies to reveal information about physical drivers on Earth. As you climb through the mirror like Alice to a world turned upside down, you will discover that data in each frequency reveals a different clue. Oil spills are seen in one wavelength but not the others, forest canopies and understories are highlighted only in certain polarizations."

You could look at a volcano that errupted recently, an interesting forest, a coastal area that has changed a lot, or even a farm land nearby you.

Notes from the Video (some is taken directly from the video):

Different polarizations can give you different information about the landscape.
Use different polorizations to better understand the landscape.
Make hypothesis about what you can see or not see on the SAR images. Which polorizations highlight which types of landscape e.g. forest or water, and why.
Does certain radar frequencies highlight different kinds of vegetation?
You could get multiple images of the same landscape could you detect how the forest is changing with time.
Use any digital medium you would like to present your story.
If you want to you can use additional data or information to provide more context e.g you could provide optical imagery to highlight features, or even provide personal context if you're familiar with the area, or anything that can add to your story and your explaination of SAR data.

SAR is a form of active remote sensing, meaning it emits and receives it own sources of energy.
SAR uses energy in the microwave band of the electromagnetic spectrum.

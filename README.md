## Notes about Challenges and Importance of Challenges

### BloomWatch: An Earth Observation Application for Global Flowering Phenology

#### Motivation and Importance
Food production is incredibly important for the world, and for that so are pollinators such as bees which also depend on plant blooming.
Pests can also cause damages to crops and if there's a scientific way to compare blooms and bloom extent or even determine the prevalence of species
over a landscape that is really useful. Quantitative decision making is really important, and being able to numerically quantify blooms, and the kinds of vegetation
in a specific area, at a specific time is useful. This is possible with NASA data.
The same tools and data that could be used for analyze plant blooms, vegetation and lanscape analysis could be used in various other useful and important applications.

#### Challenge Description:
"Your challenge is to harness the power of NASA Earth observation data to develop a tool that monitors and visualizes plant blooming events across the globe or within a specific local region, and directly addresses a specific vegetation monitoring, prediction, or management need at your chosen scale."

### Meteor Madness

#### Motivation and Importance

Asteroids pose a significant risk, and currently there is no developed technology that is reliable for redirecting an incoming asteroid. Detection of harmful asteroids could be better developed as to take appropriate mitigation strategies and plan ahead there needs to be a signifant time between detection and for example bringing deflector into a position where it could deflect an asteroid.

Dectection and Deflection Time Importance:
The earlier a deflector hits an asteroid the more substantial the deflection, so deflection an asteroid months before impact is better than weeks or days before impact.
This means its important to detect the asteroid as early as possible and then move a deflector into position where it can have the most effect.

#### Challenge Description:

"Your challenge is to develop an interactive visualization and simulation tool that enables users to explore asteroid impact scenarios, predict consequences, and evaluate mitigation strategies using real NASA and USGS datasets. Can you create a web-based platform that integrates asteroid parameter data (e.g., size, velocity, trajectory) from NASAâ€™s NEO API with USGS datasets pertaining to environmental and geological impacts (e.g., tsunami zones, seismic activity, topography), and transforms that raw data into a powerful educational and decision-support tool for global asteroid risk management?"

### Through the Radar Looking Glass: Revealing Earth Processes with SAR

#### Motivation and Importance

SAR (Synthetic Apperture Radar) Data has numerous applications, including monitoring landscape coverage during disasters such as flooding, wildfire damage, types and thickness of vegetation, pollution (oil for example), water coverage.
